 1. You ate enough to survive but were attacked by a hawk.

 You were injured in the attack and you won't be able to breed this season.

 3. You ate enough to get through another winter.

 You also found a mated and bred. Your hatchlings are growing quickly and should be out of the nest soon.

 You've done well so far but all these etra beaks to feed mean that you'll have to catch more bugs than ever.

 Eat 8 bugs to make it through your next winter.

 Well done! You've made it to you fourth year and your offspring have flown the nest.

 Did you find it easier to spot the blue bugs? If so You probably saw the proportion . This illustrates how small-scale changes in a population can take place through natural selection, an important concept in the theory of evolution.
