# GA project: The Evolution Game

This was my first project for the GA Web Development Immersive course. It is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript with jQuery.

The game is a remake of a Natural History Museum web game that is no longer online, partly because it was written in flash, which the Museum has now moved away from.

You take on the role of a bird trying to eat enough bugs to survive, the problem is that natural selection tends to work against you...
